install mariadb 
now if you want to check if its actully works > sudo systemctl status mariadb
first we need to acssec mariadb to start creating datatabase and add some tables,the code is > sudo mariadb 
defult database > show database; ( onec you get into mysql dont forget the semicolon)
and then if you wanna creat your own with new name > 
> create database nc_coffee;
now you just added a new database named nc_coffee type the code to see it > show database;
now we want to use our database we will say > use nc_coffee;
(you will notice -database changed-)
now we have empty tables in our database is you type > show database
( you will finde nothing - empty set-) 
so now lets creat one and we will give it a name and then id,name,region,roast > create table coffee_table (
--> id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
--> name varchar(255),
--> region varchar(255),
--> roast varchar(255) 
--> );
now you just created a table > show tables;
and then > describe coffee_table;
----------------------------
now we want to add a row to the table we just created, and its gonna be arranged in order = id,name,region,roast the code will be 
 > insert into coffee_table values (1, "defult rout", "canada", "light");
 now we want to pull this data out to see how it looks like
